Welcome to the rt-n56u project (by @Andi Padavan)

This project aims to improve the rt-n56u and other supported devices on the software part, allowing power user to take full control over their hardware.
This project was created in hope to be useful, but comes without warranty or support. Installing it will probably void your warranty.
Contributors of this project are not responsible for what happens next. Flash at your own risk!

# Unofficial changes in this Fork #

This fork combines changes from other padavan-ng upstream clones and
incorporates fresh linux kernel security fixes (up to a point).

**ATTENTION: Due to lack of other supported devices changes i made are ONLY tested by me on the RT-N56U device! So if these changes are working on other supported devices is unknown!!**

# How do I get set up? #

* [Get the tools to build the system](https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u/wiki/EN/HowToMakeFirmware) or use one of the pre-build images (see below)
* Feed the device with the system image file (Follow instructions of updating your current system in wiki)
* Perform factory reset
* Open web browser on http://my.router to configure the services
